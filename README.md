Concepts of Data Science: Assignment 1
#Description
This project focuses on the implementation of a Bloom filter, a probabilistic data structure. The purpose of the Bloom filter is to efficiently test if an element is a member of a set. The code for this project follows an object-oriented approach and is implemented in Python. The Bloom filter module can be used in Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and testing purposes, as well as in Python scripts for benchmarking on high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure.
